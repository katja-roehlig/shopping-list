#### Here is a small instruction manual:

* First write the store you want to go shopping in the input field and click "enter".

* After that you can type in the goods you need. With the + button you can add the goods.

* When you have bought something, you can check it off by clicking on the checkbox.

* With the X-button you delete already bought things.

* If you click on the selected store, you can change it.

* Your shopping list for that store will remain as long as you don't turn off your phone or delete the items.
